1. PREFACE 
 
The State of Connecticut (the “State”), under its State Revolving Fund (SRF) Programs, has developed a 
green  bond  framework  under  which  it  is  issuing  a  green  bond  (2017A  Bond)  and  use  the  proceeds  to 
provide  direct  reimbursement  to  projects  for  wastewater  treatment  and  drinking  water  projects.  The 
State  has  engaged  Sustainalytics  to  provide  a  second  opinion  on  its  framework  and  the  projects’  
environmental  credentials.  As  part  of  this  engagement,  Sustainalytics  held  conversations  with  various 
members of State of Connecticut’s management team to understand the sustainability impact of their 
processes and planned use of proceeds for the bond framework. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant 
public and internal documents. This document contains two sections: Framework Overview – summary 
of  the  State  of  Connecticut’s  Green Bond  framework;  and  Sustainalytics’  Opinion  –  an opinion  on  the 
framework.  
 
  
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
The State of Connecticut’s State Revolving Fund (“SRF”) Programs provide a source of low interest loans 
and other types of financial assistance to local entities for the construction, rehabilitation, expansion or 
improvement of wastewater treatment or drinking water facilities. The SRF Programs consist of: 

(1)  the Clean Water State Revolving Fund established by the State under the federal Clean Water Act, 

executed by the State’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) 

(2)  the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund established by the State under the federal Safe Drinking 

Water Act, executed by the State’s Department of Public Health 

 
The goals of these laws are to improve water quality, protect the environment and protect public health 
and  as  such,  the  State  of  Connecticut’s  SRF  bonds  are  statutorily  limited  to  funding  projects  that  are 
assessed by the state to be environmentally impactful.

3. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
For the purpose of issuing a green bond, the State of Connecticut has developed the following framework, 
which addresses the four key pillars of the Green Bond Principles (GBP): use of proceeds, project selection 
process, management of proceeds, and reporting. 
 
3.1   Use of Proceeds 
The  proceeds  of  the  green  bond  will  be  allocated  to  provide  direct  reimbursement  under  the  State 
Revolving Fund (SRF) Programs that meet the eligibility criteria defined below. 

3.1.1  Eligibility Criteria 
 

1.  CLEAN WATER SRF PROGRAM: WASTEWATER TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES 

The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated to provide direct reimbursement to capital expenditure 
(CAPEX)  projects  that  (1)  result  in  water  quality  improvements  by  removing  nutrients  (nitrogen  and 
phosphorus) and combined sewer overflow discharges into the surface waters of the State; (2) provide 
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure in the wastewater collection system; or (3) eliminate groundwater 
pollution caused by antiquated subsurface sewage disposal systems.  

Eligible projects may include: 

 
 

 
 

 

Upgrades to wastewater treatment plants to remove nutrients. 
Removal of combined sewer  overflow  discharges  through sewer separation projects, off line 
storage  projects  and  the  construction  of  a  wet  weather  treatment  process  at  wastewater 
treatment plants. 
Lining sanitary sewers to minimize groundwater from entering the sewer. 
Rehabilitating sanitary sewer pump stations to improve reliability, energy efficiency and make 
them more resilient to flooding from rain storms. 
Constructing  new  septic  systems  to  replace  existing  septic  systems  that  are  polluting  the 
groundwater. 

 
Some of the CAPEX projects will include energy efficiency components. 
 

2.  DRINKING WATER SRF PROGRAM: DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES 

The proceeds of the green bond will be allocated to provide direct reimbursement to capital expenditure 
(CAPEX)  projects  that  leads  to  safe  drinking  water  and  improved  reliability  of  safe  drinking  water 
infrastructure.  

Eligible projects may include: 

  Upgrades to water treatment plants to improve drinking water quality, comply with federal Safe 

Drinking Water Act requirements and increase reliability and efficiency of plant operations. 

  Upgrades  to  water  storage  tanks  and  pump  stations  to  increase  reliability,  efficiency, 

sustainability and reduce water loss.

  Rehabilitation  or  replacement  of  groundwater  wells  to  replace  contaminated  or  diminished 

sources and improve the efficiency of water treatment and pumping equipment. 

  Replacement or rehabilitation of water mains which have exceeded their useful service  life to 
reduce the probability of main breakage and/or water leakage and improve the efficiency of water 
treatment and pumping equipment. 
Installation  or  replacement  of  back-up  power  systems  to  ensure  the  delivery  of  a  safe  and 
sufficient drinking water supply to consumers during power outages. 

 

  Consolidation  of  public  water  systems  and  interconnections  between  public  water  systems  to 
provide  for  increased  resiliency,  efficiency  and  cost-effective  delivery  of  water  services. 
  

Please  refer  to  Appendix A  for  a  list  of  existing  eligible  projects  that will  be  directly  reimbursed  upon 
closing of the 2017A Bonds.  
 
3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
 
The  Department  of  Energy  and  Environmental  Protection  (DEEP)  is  established  to  carry  out  the 
environmental  policy of  the  State,  including  conserving,    improving  and  protecting  the  State’s  natural 
resources and environment and mitigating water, land and air pollution, administers the State’s SRF Clean 
Water Program. The State’s Department of Public Health (DPH) is the State agency that carries out the 
public health policy of the State, including the use and protection of the State’s drinking water resources. 
DEEP and DPH administer priority systems to determine eligibility for Loans under the SRF Programs. 
 
DEEP  biennially  prepares  the  Priority  List  of  eligible  water  quality  projects  identifying  wastewater 
treatment projects that are eligible for assistance from the Clean Water Program (DEEP Priority List). DPH 
annually  prepares  the  Project  Priority  List  identifying  drinking  water  projects  that  are  eligible  for 
assistance from the Drinking Water Program (DPH Priority List)1. In order to qualify for funding under the 
SRF Programs, a project must be listed on either DEEP's or DPH's Priority List as well as meet the eligibility 
criteria  detailed  above  in  section  3.1.  Once  a  project  is  placed  on  the  Priority  List,  the  potential  loan 
recipient must file an application for financial assistance for such project. The application must pass four 
levels of approval:  

(1)  evaluation and enforcement, which determines if the proposed project (i) addresses the needs 
cited by DEEP/DPH, (ii) complies with regulatory and statutory requirements, and (iii) complies 
with  the eligibility criteria detailed in section 3.1. DEEP, Bureau of Water Protection and Land 
Reuse are the departments responsible for evaluating compliance with eligibility criteria for the 
Clean  Water  Fund.  DPH,  Drinking  Water  Section  is  the  department  responsible  for  evaluating 
compliance with eligibility criteria for the Drinking Water Fund ;  

(2)  project administration, which determines project eligibility for funding in accordance with State 

and federal regulations;  

(3)  environmental  review,  which  involves  the  preparation  of an  environmental  assessment  of  the 

project; and 

(4)  credit review, which analyzes an applicant's ability to repay the Loan.

3.3        Management of Proceeds  

 
The State will track the net proceeds of the 2017A Bonds and confirm that such proceeds are used for 
eligible  green  qualified  projects.  The  proceeds  of  the  2017A  Bonds  will  be  used  to  provide  direct 
reimbursement to projects eligible under the SRF Programs. The net proceeds of the 2017A Bonds will be 
deposited in the Bond Proceeds Fund and will be expended only for the purposes of the SRF Programs. 
Pending such expenditures, the net proceeds will be invested in accordance with the State’s investment 
policy.  
 
A Financial Administrator, appointed by the Treasurer, is given responsibility to manage and coordinate 
the various financial components of the SRF Programs on a day-to-day basis. 
 

3.4    Reporting  

 
Commencing  with  the  delivery  of  the  Clean  Water  State  Revolving  Fund  Program  Annual  Report  and 
Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Annual Report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, the State will 
provide reporting on an annual basis. Such reporting will include the Borrowers, a brief project description 
for each of the projects funded with the 2017A Bonds and the amount of 2017A Bond proceeds spent on 
such projects, but only until the proceeds of the 2017A Bonds have been fully expended. Such information 
will be  posted to the  Electronic Municipal Market  Access (EMMA) website of the  Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board, accessible at www.emma.msrb.org, on an annual basis on or before the date eight months 
after the close of the fiscal year for which such information is being provided. Once the State has fully 
expended all of the proceeds of the 2017A Bonds, the State will no longer report such information to the 
holders of the 2017A Bonds as the information will remain unchanged.  However, as stated above, the 
information will always be available in the published Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program Annual 
Reports and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Annual Reports available on the Treasurer’s website 
and EMMA.  
 
When possible, the State of Connecticut will report quantitative and/or qualitative impacts resulting from 
eligible  projects  which may  include:  reduction  in  treated  water  leakage, volume  of  water/wastewater 
collected/stored/treated, and improvements in water quality through nutrient removal. This information 
will be gathered and the impact will be reported on a best effort basis. 
 
As  the  program  progresses,  DEEP  will  gather  information  regarding  the  amount  of  Combined  Sewer 
Overflows eliminated from the construction of eligible projects and will monitor the amount of nutrients 
discharged  from  wastewater  treatment  plants.  Once  these  projects  are  completed,  DEEP  will  then 
reassess and, when feasible, report on the water quality improvements made by eligible projects funded 
by the Clean Water SRF.  
 
The DPH will continue to report on the beneficial public health impacts and improved operational 
efficiencies of each project.

4  SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
 
Effects of Climate Change on the State of Connecticut’s Water Management Practices: 
According  to  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  wastewater  management  is  “an 
important sustainable development goal because it can lead directly to improved health, productivity of 
human resources, and better living conditions”2.  
 
Wastewater treatment and stormwater management are projected to become increasingly difficult due 
to climate change and the associated changes in temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea level rise and 
storm-related  damages.  The  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  has  stipulated  that  rising 
temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns are likely to increase the intensity of both floods and droughts3. 
In  a  report  issued  by  Connecticut  Governor’s  Steering  Committee  on  Climate  Change,  the  ability  of 
wastewater facilities to adapt to climate change was identified as critical to future water quality within 
Connecticut as extreme precipitation events will put additional pressure on storm sewer systems4.  
 
The water infrastructure improvement projects financed under the State of Connecticut State Revolving 
Fund  are  expected  to  provide  multiple  opportunities 
for  climate  change  mitigation  and 
adaptation. Upgraded  facilities  will  help  climate  change  mitigation  by  controlling  water  pollution, 
increasing  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  GHG  emissions.  Treatment  and  reuse  of  wastewater  and 
stormwater  will  serve  as  effective  climate  adaptation  measures,  as  improved  sewer  systems  prepare 
residents for floods and new water collection and treatment systems increase water availability during 
droughts. 
 
With  respect  to  climate  change  adaptation,  Sustainalytics  has  reviewed  documents  from  the  State  of 
Connecticut that  confirm that the State conducts studies to identify risks posed by climate change. In its 
2016 priority list, the State discloses that in 2013, Public Act No. 13-15 was passed. This act requires all 
wastewater  improvement  projects  that  may  be  affected  by  sea  level  rise  due  to  climate  change  to 
consider  ways  to mitigate  this  impact  of  climate  change  in  the  project’s  design.  All  Clean  Water  Fund 
projects require an assessment of the risk to existing wastewater infrastructure from climate change, and 
an  evalutation  of  alternatives  for  remedial  actions.  Sustainalytics  is  of  the  opinion  that  basing  the 
adaptation eligibility criterion on specific risk studies strengthens the impact of the use of proceeds, as it 
establishes a clear case that the adaptation infrastructure is being funded as a direct response to climate 
change risks. 
 
State Revolving Funds (SRFs) can be used to make the State of Connecticut more resilient to a changing 
climate. By providing critical support for a variety of drinking water and wastewater projects, the State is 
able to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change on water supply.

Importance of State Revolving Fund in the State of Connecticut: 
The large magnitude of the country’s needs reflect the challenges confronting water systems as they deal 
with an infrastructure network that has aged considerably since these systems were constructed, in many 
cases, 50 to 100 years ago5.  
 
In 2013, the EPA released a study showing that $384 billion in improvements are needed for the nation’s 
drinking water infrastructure through 2030 for systems to continue providing safe drinking water to 297 
million  Americans6.  Based  on  these  results,  the  State  of  Connecticut  had  been allocated  1.01%  of the 
above-mentioned  amount  between  2014-2017.  Furthermore,  the  U.S.  EPA  Clean  Watershed  Needs 
Survey, reported to Congress in 2012, estimated that the overall need for improvements in Connecticut 
to meet the goals of the federal Clean Water Act was approximately $4.6 billion, including treatment plant 
construction and improvements, and combined sewer overflow correction needs7. 
 
Together, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund are enabling 
the State of Connecticut to provide low-interest loans and grants to improve water infrastructure in order 
to protect public health and improve the quality of water resources. 
 
Alignment  with  Green  Bond  Principles  2016:  Sustainalytics  has  determined  that  the  State  of 
Connecticut’s Green Bond Framework aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2016. For 
detailed information please refer to Appendix B: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review 
Form. 
 
Conclusion 
 
By  providing  direct  reimbursement  to projects  in wastewater treatment and  drinking water,  the State 
aims  to  improve  water  conservation  and  manage  climate  change  risks  by  addressing  system 
vulnerabilities.  Such  actions  are  recognized  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  as 
effective climate mitigation and adaptation measures. 
 
The State of Connecticut’s approach to selecting projects and managing green bond proceeds is robust, 
and its reporting on the use of proceeds is transparent. The State’s SRF green bond follows the guidance 
provided  by the  Green  Bond  Principles  and  is  in alignment  with  its  four  pillars  –  the  use  of  proceeds, 
process of project evaluation and selection, management of proceeds and reporting. Based on the above 
considerations,  Sustainalytics  is  of  the  view  that  the  State  of  Connecticut’s  green  bond  is  robust  and 
credible.
