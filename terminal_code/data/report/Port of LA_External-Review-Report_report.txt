1. PREFACE 
 
The Port of Los Angeles has engaged Sustainalytics to provide a second opinion on its Green Bond Series 
2016C  (Green  Bond)  issuance  and  the  bond’s  environmental  credentials.  As  part  of  this  engagement, 
Sustainalytics held conversations with various members of the Port of Los Angeles management team to 
understand the sustainability impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds for the bond 
issuance. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public and internal documents. This document contains 
two sections: Framework Overview – a summary of the Port of Los Angeles green bond framework; and 
Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework.  
  
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
The Port of Los Angeles is located in San Pedro Bay in the San Pedro and Wilmington neighbourhoods of 
Los Angeles. In terms of physical size, the Port covers approximately 7,500 acres (4,300 acres of land and 
3,200 acres of water). The Port generally encompasses approximately 43 miles of waterfront berthing and 
27 terminal facilities, including eight major container cargo terminals, four break-bulk facilities, three dry 
bulk  facilities,  seven  liquid  bulk  cargo  terminals,  two  passenger cruise terminals,  one  vehicle  handling 
facility, and two multi-use facilities. The Port of Los Angeles’s main imports include furniture, footwear, 
electronics, automobile parts, and apparel, and exports span wastepaper, cotton, resins, animal feed, and 
scrap metal. During the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, the Port of Los Angeles handled 8,390,513 20-
foot-equivalent  units  (TEUs),  and  based  on  container  volumes,  was  the  busiest  container  port  in  the 
United States in calendar year 2015. 
 
This high level of activity inevitably has environmental consequences; however, the Port of Los Angeles is 
committed to environmental stewardship and is working to reduce air emissions, improve water quality, 
modernize facilities and cultivate the development of new technologies. In line with these sustainability 
objectives, the Port of Los Angeles is planning to issue a Green Bond to refund earlier issued bonds to 
finance expenditures related to a number of selected green projects, including the Harry Bridges Blvd. 
Buffer and Cabrillo Shallow Water Habitat, as well as the design and construction of the LEED-certified 
Port of Los Angeles Police Headquarters.  
 
3. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
 
For this sustainability bond issued by the Port of Los Angeles, a framework has been created that follows 
the four key pillars of the Green Bond Principles (“GBP”): 

  Use of Proceeds; 
  Selection Process; 
  Management of Proceeds; and 
  Reporting.

Terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation  
  Designing and constructing an expansion of a shallow water habitat for fish and foraging space 

for birds2; and 

  Use of dredged material for environmental enhancement of a shallow water habitat. 
 

Projects focused on the activities above are eligible to be refunded in whole or in part by an allocation of 
the Green Bond proceeds. The Port of Los Angeles has selected the projects listed in Appendix A for the 
allocation of Green Bond proceeds.   
 

3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
 
Projects  refinanced  through  the  Green  Bond  proceeds  were  evaluated  and  selected  based  on  (i) 
commercial feasibility (locational ease, land use, availability of resources); (ii) alignment with the eligibility 
criteria; and (iii) alignment with the Port of Los Angeles’ internal environmental management program. 
 
The Port of Los Angeles has developed and maintained an environmental management program that will:  
 

1.  Ensure  this  environmental  policy  is  communicated  to  Port  staff,  its  customers,  and  the 

community;   

2.  Ensure compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations; 
3.  Ensure  environmental  considerations  include  feasible  and cost  effective  options  for  exceeding   

applicable regulatory requirements;   

4.  Define  and  establish  environmental  objectives,  targets,  and  best  management  practices  and 

monitor performance; 

5.  Ensure  the  Port  maintains  a  Customer  Outreach  Program  to  address  common  environmental 

issues; and   

6.  Fulfill  the  responsibilities  of  each  generation  as  trustee  of  the  environment  for  succeeding 
generations through environmental awareness and communication with employees, customers, 
regulatory agencies, and neighboring communities. 

 
The  Port  states  that  it  is  committed  to  the  spirit  and  intent  of  this  policy  and  the  laws,  rules  and 
regulations, which give it foundation. All projects refinanced through Green Bond proceeds are selected 
based on their adherence to the above stated requirements of the Port’s environmental management 
program. 
 
In  addition,  the  Port  of  Los  Angeles  has  confirmed  to  Sustainalytics  that  all  selected  projects  have 
undergone an Environmental Impact Review (EIR), and a stakeholder consultation process. Port of Los 
Angeles has also confirmed that for all selected projects, the relevant EIR and stakeholder consultation 
must conclude negligible environmental disruption.

3.3        Management of Proceeds 

 
As previously indicated, the Port of Los Angeles Green Bond proceeds will be held in a trust account and 
used to advance refund a portion of the Series 2009B Bonds and pay a portion of the costs of issuance of 
the Series 2016 Bonds. The portion of the Series 2009B Bonds which would be refunded using the Port of 
Los Angeles Green Bond proceeds was determined by reviewing Series 2009B Bond drawdown statements 
and  identifying  proceeds  that  were  drawn  down  for  the  following  three  projects  (the  Green  Bond 
Projects): 
 

1.  Harry Bridges Boulevard Buffer – Project #: 2482300; 
2.  Port of Los Angeles Police Headquarters – Project #:2458300; and 
3.  Cabrillo Shallow Water Habitat – Project #:2503900. 

 
Following an examination of Series 2009B Bond drawdown statements spanning August 2009 through 
May 2011, the following amount of proceeds were drawn down from the Series 2009B Construction Fund 
related to the Green Bond Projects: 
 

  Harry Bridges Boulevard Buffer 
  Port of Los Angeles Police Headquarters 
  Cabrillo Shallow Water Habitat 
Total 

18,757,771 
13,978,247 
3,588,970 
36,324,987 

 
 
Therefore, all the funds will be allocated immediately, as no bond proceeds will be used to initiate new 
projects.  
 

3.4  Reporting  

 
Allocation Reporting 
 
Given that the Port of Los Angeles Green Bond proceeds will primarily be used to refund prior borrowings, 
and  given  that  the  Port  of  Los  Angeles  Green  Bond  proceeds  will  not  be  utilized  to  fund  any  new 
development projects, no ongoing reporting requirements are envisioned at this time. 
 
Impact Reporting 
 
The Port of Los Angeles commits to provide reporting on the following KPIs for the three projects within 
the “Sustainability” section of the Port of Los Angeles website. 
 
 
Harry Bridges Boulevard Buffer:

4. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
 
Sustainability performance of the issuer: a strong environmental commitment  
 
The  Port  of  Los  Angeles  is  a  global  leader  in  sustainable  port  management  and  has  demonstrated  a 
commitment to mitigating environmental and social risks associated with its operations, as evidenced by 
its policy, Strategic Plan Update, and its ambitious targets under the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action 
Plan. The Port of Los Angeles has already achieved significant milestones in reducing port-related diesel 
particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions under the two stages of CAAP. Additionally, 
the Port introduced various innovative solutions, such as the Clean Truck Program. The Port of Los Angeles 
has  received  and  maintained  external  certification  for  its  environmental  management  system  (ISO 
14001:2004)  and  conducts  robust  environmental  impact  reviews  and  comprehensive  stakeholder 
consultation  process  for  all  its  projects.  Given  its  strong  environmental  policy  and  past  performance, 
Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Port of Los Angeles is well positioned to issue a green bond. 
 
The importance of improving the sustainability of shipping and port lands development 
 
Although shipping and ports play an important role in driving global economic growth, they nonetheless 
cause a number of negative environmental impacts, including significant amounts of air pollution, water 
quality and habitat degradation, among others. According to the International Maritime Organization, the 
shipping industry is responsible for 3.3% of global GHG emissions.3  Shipping-specific emissions – primarily 
sulfur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides  and  particulates  –  endanger  biological  diversity,  natural  resources  and 
human health. Although a fraction of pollution associated with shipping occurs far from land, an estimated 
70-80% of it is released within 400 km of land4. Another concern is storm water runoff at ports which 
poses a threat to local water quality due to high paved-to-unpaved surface ratio and site pollution.   
 
As a result, there has been increasing societal pressure on port authorities to actively work to reduce their 
pollution levels  and environmental damage,  as well as  increase sustainability of the industry and port 
infrastructure. Stronger international regulations have also been introduced, including the International 
Maritime  Organization’s  Marpol  Annex  VI  regulation,  which  obliges  the  shipping  industry  to  reduce 
sulphur emissions in key Emission Control Areas (ECAs). Many of the world’s largest ports have responded 
by  introducing  strategic  plans  to  reduce  GHG  emissions  and  other  environmental  impacts.  Numerous 
global initiatives have been created, such as the World Ports Climate Change Initiative launched at the 
symposium hosted by the Port of Los Angeles in 2008, where 55 of the world’s largest ports committed 
to significantly cut their GHG emissions.  
 
Although the Port of Los Angeles’ participation in the Clean Air Action Plan has resulted in a significant 
reduction in harmful air emissions within the San Pedro Bay, it should be noted that although the projects 
refunded by this bond may have contributed in part to this reduction of harmful air emissions over the 
last ten years, they were not the primary drivers of these results.

Furthermore,  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  states  that  climate  change  will  likely  affect 
marine transportation infrastructure and logistics in many ways, both positive and negative. Sustainalytics 
is therefore of the opinion that climate change adaptation in environmental project planning should be 
an  area  to  consider  for  the  Port  of  Los  Angeles,  as  like  other  coastal  infrastructure  “Harbor  facilities, 
including docks and bridges, may have to be raised to accommodate higher tides and storm surges, as sea 
levels rise”. 5  
 
Nevertheless, Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the Port of Los Angeles green infrastructure projects are 
a step in the right direction towards increasing sustainability of ports and the shipping industry in general. 
 
Clear environmental benefits offered by green bond projects 
 

1)  Development of natural features on port lands offers numerous environmental and community 
benefits. They can increase the amount of impervious surface at port facilities and thereby reduce 
storm water runoff and improve local water quality. Soil remediation provides additional benefits 
for preserving water quality and preserving natural environment. Additionally, such projects can 
help mitigate negative environmental impacts on residential neighborhoods in close proximity to 
ports.  

2)  Energy efficient buildings are explicitly recognized by the ICMA Green Bond Principles as offering 
clear environmental benefits. Buildings are a significant contributor to GHG and carbon emissions. 
Improving their energy efficiency is a robust way to mitigate the effects of climate change. LEED 
certification  is  an  independent  verification  of  a  building’s  energy  and  resource  efficiency;  for 
example,  LEED  Gold  certified  buildings  can  generate  up  to  34%  less  GHG  emissions  than  the 
average commercial building.  

3)  Shallow water habitats contribute to aquatic biodiversity conservation, which is one of the broad 
categories recognized by the GBP as eligible projects. They provide important feeding and nursery 
grounds  for  numerous  fish  species  and  encourage  bird  foraging.  Additionally,  the  use  of  the 
dredged material can greatly enhance the environmental value of shallow water habitats6. Given 
the shipping industry’s overall negative impact on aquatic biodiversity, the Port of Los Angeles’s 
initiative to expand shallow water habitats is a good way to mitigate these impacts.  

 
 
 
Alignment with ICMA Green Bond Principles 2016 
 
Sustainalytics has determined that the Port of Los Angeles’s Green Bond aligns to the four pillars of the 
ICMA Green Bond Principles 2016. For detailed information please refer to Appendix C: Green Bond 
Principles Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form

Conclusion 
 
By  refunding  bonds  that  financed  projects  that  actively  aim  to  reduce  the  levels  of  pollution  and 
environmental damage caused by port activities through soil and water management, constructing energy 
efficient buildings, and preserving aquatic biodiversity, the Port of Los Angeles is making important strides 
towards improving the sustainability of their port infrastructure.  
 
The Port of Los Angeles’s approach to selecting projects and managing green bond proceeds is robust, 
and  its  reporting  on  the  use  of  proceeds,  with  KPIs  that  capture  soil,  energy  and  water  impacts,  is 
transparent. The Green Bond follows the guidance provided by the Green Bond Principles 2016 and is in 
alignment  with  its  four  pillars  –  the  use  of  proceeds,  process  of  project  evaluation  and  selection, 
management of proceeds and reporting. Based on the above considerations, Sustainalytics is of the view 
that the Port of Los Angeles’s Green Bond is robust and credible.

Port of Los 
Angeles 
Police 
Headquarters 

A brownfield site was developed into a 30-acre park that 
serves as a natural buffer for the residential community 
from the industrial port facilities. The soil on the site was 
cleaned up from hazardous substances and petroleum 
products, and clean fill material was imported to 
construct the berm. Work also included passive‐use 
landscaping, restrooms, water features, play areas, and 
hardscaped areas with dense trees and rolling 
hills/berms/retaining walls providing a buffering effect. 
The park contributes to preserving local water quality 
through better storm water infiltration and reduced soil 
contamination. 
The Port of Los Angeles Police Headquarters was designed 
and built to energy- and environmentally efficient LEED™ 
“Gold” standards. Sustainable elements include: pervious 
paving and landscaped bio-filtration/storm water 
retention areas; high‐reflectance paving and cool roof 
materials to reduce heat island impacts; native landscape 
materials and reduction of installed turf; high efficiency 
irrigation equipment and controllers; high‐efficiency

total construction materials (by value) were manufactured 
using recycled content. 
A 50‐acre expansion of the Cabrillo Shallow Water Habitat 
(CSWH) was designed and constructed in the Outer Los 
Angeles Harbor. The purpose of shallow water habitats is 
to provide enhanced biological value for various fish 
species and encourage bird foraging. Dredge material 
from the Channel Deepening Project was used for 
environmental enhancement of the CSWH.7Improved 
habitat value created 24.3 biological mitigation credits in 
the Outer Harbor Mitigation Bank used to offset impacts 
from port landfills in future development projects.

Removed 10,008 tons of chemically-impacted soil from 
the site upon which the Harry Bridges Boulevard Buffer 
was constructed 
Relative to baseline buildings, the Port of Los Angeles 
Police Headquarters achieves energy cost savings of 
28.1%. 
The building’s heating, ventilation and air conditioning 
systems do not use HCFC’s and Halons. 
14 bicycle racks have been provided to serve more than 
203 full-time equivalents 
Out of 73 parking spaces, 4 preferred spaces (more than 
5% of total) have been provided for low-emitting fuel 
efficient vehicles. 

Landscape planters, porous pavement, bio-retention 
basins, trench drain filters and downspout filters 
effectively treat 100% of the average annual post-
development Total Suspended Solids 
In an effort to reduce “heat island” impacts, 51% of the 
on-site parking stalls are located underground or under 
cover.  Furthermore, the building’s roof has been 
constructed with area takeoffs and roof sloping to 
further reduce “heat island” impacts 
Potable irrigation water consumption has been reduced 
by at least 50% through the use of high efficiency 
irrigation technology 
Potable water use has been reduced by 40% through use 
of dual-flush water closets, and low-flow urinals, 
lavatories, showerheads and kitchen sinks. 
The overall building project ultimately diverted 7,195.99 
tons (96.6%) of on-site generated construction waste 
from landfill. 
26.03% of the total building materials content has been 
manufactured using recycled materials. 

73% of the total wood-based building materials are 
harvested from FSC-certified forests. 
 

Utilizing dredged material, the Port of Los Angeles created 
a habitat for birds, fish, and various invertebrates which 
generated 24.3 biological mitigation credits
