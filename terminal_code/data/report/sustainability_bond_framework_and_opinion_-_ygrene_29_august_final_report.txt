1. PREFACE 
Ygrene  Energy  Fund  Inc.  (“Ygrene”),  through  its  financing  programs  (“Programs”),  finances  energy 
efficiency, renewable energy and water conservation projects on private residential and commercial real 
property (“Qualified Improvements”). Ygrene intends to issue Green Bonds (also known as Green Use of 
Proceeds Securitized Bond). This financing is enabled by the issuance and sale of notes secured by limited 
obligation improvement bonds that are in turn secured by property tax liens on the improved properties 
(collectively called Property Assessed Clean Energy or “PACE” bonds). Ygrene has engaged Sustainalytics 
to  provide  an  independent  opinion  on  its  framework  and  on  the  environmental  credentials  of  the 
issuance.  Sustainalytics  reviewed  several  relevant  documents,  the  planned  use  of  proceeds  and  held 
conversations  with  various  members  of  Ygrene’s  management  team  to  understand  the  sustainability 
impact of their business processes and planned use of proceeds. This document contains two sections: 
Framework Overview – summary of the Ygrene framework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion of 
the framework.  
  
2. INTRODUCTION 
Ygrene  Energy  Fund  Inc.  is  a  finance  company  providing  clean  energy  funding  for  residential  and 
commercial properties throughout the United States. Founded in 2010, Ygrene is headquartered in Santa 
Rosa, California, and currently operates in three states (California, Florida, and Georgia). Ygrene’s business 
model  is  based  on  providing  financing  for  real  property  improvement  projects  involving  Qualified 
Improvements. It does so by partnering with local and regional governmental entities to administer and 
fund their PACE programs. It is the PACE legislation that allows for the highly secure property tax liens 
that make PACE such a successful model. 
 
The PACE Process 
PACE legislation lets cities, counties, joint powers authorities, interlocal districts and other governmental 
entities (“Jurisdictions”) raise capital through issuance of PACE bonds. Through the purchase of the PACE 
bonds, Ygrene provides the capital that enables property owners to carry out Qualified Improvements 
projects. The property owners, that meet eligibility criteria, apply to the Program directly or through a 
Certified Contractor and repay  the  financing via a special tax or assessment on their property tax bill.  
Following receipt of approval by the property owner, Ygrene directly pays the Certified Contractors for 
the installation of Qualified Improvements. Property owners can choose both the Certified Contractors 
and the Qualified Improvement, both of which must be pre-approved by Ygrene. By virtue of this financing 
structure,  property  owners  do  not  incur  upfront  payments  for  their  energy  and  water  efficient 
improvements and are able to repay the financing over a much longer term than is customarily available 
for such projects. Municipalities service this repayment as a part of their annual tax collection process, 
and remit these tax payments via a trustee to the ultimate holder of the PACE bonds.  
 
Securitization of PACE Bonds  
Ygrene provides collateral in the form of a PACE bond portfolio, and uses the liens and tax payments to 
back its securitizations. Hence, the PACE bonds held by Ygrene (or a closely held Ygrene SPE) become a 
securitized PACE bond portfolio that in turn is secured by the property tax liens and PACE assessments 
levied against  the  participating owners’ properties. Ygrene  is directly responsible for originating these 

 

2 

© Sustainalytics 2016 

assessments,  80-90%  of  which  come  through  contractor  referrals.  A  contractor  certified  through  the 
Program  (listed  on  the  website  or  provided  by  Ygrene  customer  service  representatives),  “Certified 
Contractor” must be selected by the property owner to install the Qualifying Improvements. Fees charged 
through the Program reimburse Ygrene and its Jurisdiction partners for administrative and underwriting 
costs.  Ygrene’s  principal  source  of  revenue  accrues  from  the  difference  in  interest  rates  between  its 
sources of capital and coupons on its funding activities. 
 
Currently, Ygrene operates Programs in three states (California, Florida, and Georgia). In California, Ygrene 
administers its YgreneWorks Clean Energy PACE funding program, established by a state wide joint powers 
authority (Golden State Finance Authority). Ygrene’s Clean Energy Green Corridor Program  operates in 
Florida through the Green Corridor interlocal district, by which Ygrene is contracted to administer and 
fund  its  Florida  PACE  programs.  In  Georgia,  Ygrene  is  partnering  with  Invest  Atlanta,  the  City’s 
development authority, to develop the Clean Energy Atlanta PACE Program.

3. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
Ygrene  is  planning  to  securitize  PACE  bonds  to  create  “Green  Bonds”. The  proceeds  finance  Qualified 
Improvements on residential and commercial property of Program participants. The PACE bonds acquired 
from  the  issuers  by  Ygrene  through  its  YgreneWorks  Clean  Energy  PACE  funding,  Clean  Energy  Green 
Corridor,  and  Clean  Energy  Atlanta  programs  have  been  confirmed  by  an  external  auditor  to  be  used 
exclusively for financing of Qualified Improvements. The following sections summarize Ygrene’s Green 
Bond Framework with respect to the use of proceeds, project selection, the management of proceeds, 
and reporting.

4.  Emerging Technology & Innovative Solutions 
Ygrene can approve financing for Qualified Improvements that are not “off the shelf”.  These Qualified 
Improvements may involve any measures that save energy or water, generate energy from renewable 
sources, measurably improve the property’s ability to resist wind and storm damage, or provide charging 
stations for electric vehicles.  Examples include: 
 

  Energy Management and Demand 

  Other fuel sources (emerging 

Reduction Systems 

  HVAC Zoning Control Systems 
Industrial Equipment Controls 
 

technologies) 

  Co-generation (heat and energy) 
  Agricultural Water Saving Systems

 
3.1.1  Eligibility Criteria 
To be funded through the Green Bonds, the Qualified Improvements must meet the following eligibility 
criteria: 

1. 
2. 

It must fall under one or more of the categories specified in the Use of Proceeds Section 3.1.  
It must meet certain  product-specific eligibility criteria as defined in the  Eligible Measures List 
attached hereto as Annex 1.  

3.  Products are funded within the 24 months prior to the issuance of the bonds. 

 

Ygrene’s  product-specific  eligibility  criteria  (as  outlined  in  Annex  1)  reference  third-party  efficiency 
program standards and certified product directories, when available, and rely on internal and external 
subject  matter  expertise  to  generate  relevant  standards  and  eligibility  specifications.  This  third-party 
reference process ensures that products have met widely recognized standards of efficiency. 
 
The third-party sources used by Ygrene programs include the following: 

  California Building Energy Efficiency 

Program (Title 24) 

  American National Standards Institute 

(ANSI)  

  A/C, Heating & Refrigeration Institute 

(AHRI) 

  Building Performance Institute (BPI) 
  California Energy Commission (CEC) 
  California Plumbing Code 
  National Plumbing Code 
  National Electrical Code 
  National Fuel Gas Code 

 

  California Solar Initiative Program  
  Energy Star Certification 
  EPA Certified Wood Stoves 
  Home Ventilation Institute 
  National Electrical Code 
  National Fuel Gas Code 
  American Wind Energy Association 
  Solar Rating and Certification Corporation 
  WaterSense Qualification 
  High Velocity Hurricane Zone (HVHZ) 
  Florida Building Code 5th Edition 


© Sustainalytics 2016 

3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
To  be  funded  through  the  proceeds  of  the  issuance  and  the  underlying  PACE  bonds,  the  Qualified 
Improvements (a product or a bundle of products outlined in Annex 1) must meet the eligibility criteria 
specified above in section 3.1. Ygrene administers the YgreneWorks Clean Energy PACE funding, Clean 
Energy Green Corridor, and Clean Energy Atlanta programs. These programs have been confirmed by an 
external  auditor  to  be  used  exclusively  for  financing  of  Qualified  Improvements.  Ygrene  is  directly 
responsible for originating the Qualified Improvement projects. In this process, Ygrene ensures that the 
Qualified Improvements meet Ygrene’s product specific eligibility criteria.  
 

3.3        Management of Proceeds  
The proceeds of the green bonds issued by Ygrene will be immediately allocated towards refinancing the 
eligible projects. The Green Bonds are secured by the PACE bonds in the pool, an amount equal to or less 
than the amount of the bond authorization.  Ygrene, or a Ygrene-controlled SPE, is the sole buyer of PACE 
bonds issued by the partnering Jurisdictions. Therefore, the net proceeds arising from the issuance of the 
Green Bonds are used to repay PACE bonds funding Qualified Improvements.  
 
The process of Jurisdictions issuing PACE bonds and Ygrene or a Ygrene SPE purchasing the PACE bonds 
occurs  simultaneously.  Purchase  of  the  PACE  bonds  is  made  using  funds  from  various  Ygrene  credit 
facilities,  resulting  in  full  allocation  of  the  proceeds  to  the  PACE  bonds  that  are  backed  by  the 
assessment/tax lien pool.   
 
3.4 Reporting  
Allocation Reporting 
Ygrene will disclose the allocation of the PACE bonds to the Green Bonds in an aggregated way. Ygrene 
has also confirmed that their external auditor will provide verification on allocation of bond proceeds to 
eligible projects. Given that all proceeds will be allocated immediately, verification on allocation of bond 
proceeds will be disclosed all at once at issuance of the Green Bonds. 
 
Impact Reporting 
Ygrene will report on estimated impact in an aggregated way in the following areas: 

  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions  
  Energy savings  
  Renewable energy generation 
  Water savings 

 
Ygrene imports data compiled from its administrative software system, the U.S. EPA eGRID Power Profiler 
and  the  GHG  Equivalency  Calculator  into  a  private  label  virtual  audit  software  tool.    This  proprietary 
system, developed by a California company and approved by Pacific Gas and Electric and the California 
Energy Commission, calculates energy savings and emission reductions for all Ygrene originated projects. 
Where applicable, Ygrene estimates both annual and lifetime metrics of the installed improvements. The 
reporting process and associated metrics are listed below.

aggregated  for  all  projects  incorporated  in  the  Green  Bond  at  issuance.  The  impact  model  used  to 
calculate  home  energy  savings  is  Ygrene’s  proprietary  virtual  audit  tool,  derivative  of  a  methodology 
developed for Pacific Gas and Electric and approved by the California Energy Commission, developed for 
Ygrene by a Novato, CA company.  
 
2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

  Aggregated annual and lifetime kWh Savings 
  Aggregated annual and lifetime Therm Savings 
  Aggregated Annual Energy Savings (kWh-e & bill savings) 
  Aggregated Lifetime Energy Savings (kWh-e & bill savings) 

 
Renewable Energy Generation  
1. Methodology 
Renewable  energy  generation  estimates  are  reported  for  solar  photovoltaic  installation  projects.  The 
aggregated  impact  estimates  derive  from  methodologies  used  by  the  National  Renewable  Energy 
Laboratory's PV Watts Calculator. 
 
2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

  Aggregated Solar System Size (W) 
  Aggregated Annual Energy Savings (kWh & bill savings) 
  Aggregated Lifetime Energy Savings (kWh & bill savings) 

 
Water Savings 
1.  Methodology

4. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
 
Three innovative programs to promote home energy efficiency: Ygrene’s three financing programs: The 
YgreneWorks Clean Energy PACE funding program (California), The Clean Energy Green Corridor Program 
(Florida),  and  The  Clean  Energy  Atlanta  PACE  Program  (Georgia)  are  an  effective  way  to  promote  the 
uptake of energy and water conservation products as well as renewable energy-generating products in 
these  three  US  states.  PACE  incentivizes  home  owners  to  install  green  products  by  financing  their 
installation  through  increased  home  property  taxes,  payable  over  an  extended  time  frame.  Hence, 
homeowners do not have to pay for these energy efficiency renovations upfront, and associated costs are 
often  offset  by  energy  savings.  Ygrene,  as a PACE  administrator,  offers  homeowners  financing  for  the 
green investments which are paid back through an increase in property taxes. Therefore, Ygrene, with its 
three  financing  programs,  is  promoting  and  helping  home  owners  install  green  projects  and  improve 
home energy efficiency.  
 
Alignment with  Green  Bond  Principles  2016:  Sustainalytics  has  determined  that  Ygrene’s  green  bond 
Framework aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2016. For detailed information please 
see Appendix 2: Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. 
 
Conclusion  
Residential homes and commercial properties in the US are a significant source of the country’s overall 
GHG  emissions.  In  2014,  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  reported  that 
commercial and residential homes contributed to 12% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, 
the EPA reported that indirect emissions from electricity used by homes and businesses have increased 
by 27% since 1990, due to increasing electricity consumption for lighting, heating, air conditioning, and 
appliances.1 Ygrene supports residential and commercial renewable energy, energy efficiency, and water 
efficiency by providing financing to eligible improvement projects in California, Florida, and Georgia. Given 
that total property tax assessments backing the PACE bonds will meet or exceed the proceeds of the green 
bond, the capital raised through the issuance of the bond will be allocated entirely for energy or water 
efficient home improvements, through the purchase of PACE bonds. Ygrene’s Green Bond framework is 
aligned with the ICMA Green Bond Principles 2016. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the green bond 
Framework is robust, credible and effective in supporting energy efficiency projects for residential and 
commercial properties in California, Florida, and Georgia. 
 
Based  on  the  above  points,  Sustainalytics  considers  Ygrene’s  Green  Bond  Framework  to  be  robust, 
credible and transparent.
