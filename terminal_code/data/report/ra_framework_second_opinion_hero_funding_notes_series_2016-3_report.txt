1. PREFACE 

Renovate America, Inc. intends to issue a series of notes (the “Notes”) as a Green Use of Proceeds Securitized 
Bond1  under  its  funding  program  called  Home  Energy  Renovation  Opportunity  (“HERO”)  Funding.  The  HERO 
Funding Notes, Series 2016-3 are issued through HERO Funding 2016 (“the Issuer”). Renovate America retained 
Sustainalytics to review the structure of the issuance and to provide an opinion on the alignment of the Notes 
with the Green Bond Principles 2016 (“GBP”) issued by the International Capital Market Association (“ICMA”). 
The Notes are secured by a pool of limited obligation improvement bonds called Property Assessed Clean Energy 
(“PACE”)  bonds,  the  proceeds  of  which  are  used  to  finance  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy  and  water 
conservation projects and products.  
 
Sustainalytics engaged with members of Renovate America’s management team to understand the sustainability 
impact  of  the  issuance  and  reviewed  the  use  of  proceeds  for  the  issuance  of  the  Notes.  Sustainalytics  also 
reviewed  public  and  internal  documents  from  Renovate  America  specifically  relevant  to  the  Notes.  This 
document  contains  two  sections:  Framework  Overview  –  summary  of  the  Renovate  America  Green  Use  of 
Proceeds Securitized Bond framework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on Renovate America’s issuance. 
  

2. INTRODUCTION 

Overview 
Renovate America is a technology-focused finance company headquartered in San Diego, California, with over 
650 full-time employees. Founded in 2009, it partners with local governments to administer financing for home 
improvement projects involving installation of energy efficiency, renewable energy and water efficiency products 
through  its  Home  Energy  Renovation  Opportunity  (“HERO”)  program.  The  HERO  Program  received  a  Climate 
Leadership Certificate for Innovative Partnerships by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March 
2016.  The  HERO  program  operates  under  California’s  PACE  legislation,  which  allows  homeowners  to  finance 
renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency  and  water  efficiency  renovations  through  voluntary  property  tax 
assessments.  Renovate  America  is  retained  by  local  municipalities  to  establish  and  administer  their  PACE 
programs. As of August 2016, Renovate has financed over 1.7 billion USD in PACE funding for 74,000 residential 
property owners. 
 
The PACE Process 
Since 2009, the HERO Program has been providing homeowners with the opportunity to finance solar, energy 
and water efficiency and renewable energy improvements at no upfront cost. Enabled by PACE legislation, local 
governments raise capital through issuances of limited obligation municipal bonds or PACE bonds. The proceeds 
from  these  bonds  are  administered  by  the  HERO  program  and  are  used  to  enable  homeowners  to  carry  out 
renewable energy, energy and water efficiency home improvements. The HERO program pays the contractors 
directly  for  the  installation  of  water  efficient,  energy  efficient  or  renewable  energy  generating  products  in 
consumer homes. Homeowners, through the HERO technology platform, choose both the contractors and the 
eligible products to be installed on their properties. By virtue of the PACE financing structure, homeowners do 
not  incur  upfront  payments  for  their  energy  and  water  efficient  home  improvements.  Instead,  homeowners 
repay  the  financing  for  their  green  renovations  through  property  tax  payments.  Municipalities  collect  this 
repayment as a part of their annual tax collection process, and remit these tax payments to PACE bondholders

via a trustee.  In July 2016, the White House issued a statement announcing executive actions to support the 
expansion of PACE financing. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) also issued guidance on July 19, 2016 
confirming  that  properties  with  PACE  assessments  can  be  purchased  and  refinanced  with  FHA  mortgage 
insurance, subject to certain requirements being met. 
 
Securitization of PACE Bonds through the Issuer 
The  Notes  are  secured  by  a  pool  of  PACE  bonds.  The  PACE  bonds  in  turn  are  secured  by  the  property  tax 
assessments or PACE assessments levied against the homeowners’ properties. Renovate America is responsible 
for originating these PACE assessments.  
 
Renovate  America  has  more  than  8,000  registered  licensed  contractors  participating  in  its  HERO  program. 
Renovate  America  provides  these  contractors  with  training  programs  on  marketing  and  eligible  equipment 
criteria, access to financing and marketing data, and tracking capabilities. All registration and administration fees 
charged are split between other partners and service providers of the PACE program (i.e. municipalities, legal 
consultants,  public  finance  consultants etc.). Renovate  America’s  principal  source  of  revenue  stems  from the 
difference in interest rates between its provision of funds to the issuers for their PACE programs and borrowing 
activities, and origination fees. 
 
HERO 2016-3 NOTES  
 
The  Notes  are  initially  secured  by  180  limited  obligation  improvement  bonds  (each,  a  “PACE  Bond”,  and 
collectively  the  “PACE  Bond  Portfolio”)  issued  by  LA  County,  Western  Riverside  Council  of  Governments 
(“WRCOG”) and San Bernardino Associated Governments (“SANBAG”).  The initial PACE Bond Portfolio is secured 
by  12,394  PACE  assessments  levied  against  11,936  residential  properties  (“PACE  Assessments”).  The  average 
PACE Assessment is valued at 21,325.95 USD with an average annual payment of 2,851.57 USD. The transaction 
benefits from credit enhancement in the form of excess spread, overcollateralization, and a liquidity reserve. 
 
The proceeds from the issuance of the Notes will be used by the Issuer to acquire the initial PACE Bonds from 
the Transferor and to pay certain expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the Residual 
Certificate. Additionally, 64,045,000.00 USD of the proceeds will be deposited in a pre-funding account, which 
may be used to acquire up to 66,025,000.00 USD in subsequent PACE Bonds.   
 
Renovate America has disclosed that the proceeds of the 256,198,000.00 USD HERO 2016-3 Notes are initially 
secured by 264,122,073.81 USD in property tax assessments.

International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials 

The HERO product specific eligibility criteria (as outlined in Appendix 1) for the projects outlined above, reference 
third-party efficiency program standards and certified product directories (when available) that rely on internal 
and  external  subject  matter  expertise  to  generate  relevant  standards  and  eligibility  specifications.  This  third-
party reference process ensures that products have met a nationally recognized standard of efficiency, and have 
submitted the necessary performance documentation in order to be listed in the directories. 
 
The third-party sources used for the HERO eligibility specifications are prioritized as follows: 
•  American National Standards Institute 
•  ASTM International 
•  Air Conditioning Heating and Refrigeration Institute 
•  Building Performance Institute 
•  California Energy Commission 
•  California Self Generation Incentive Program 
•  California Solar Initiative Program 
•  California Title 24, Section 6 Building Efficiency Standards 
•  Cool Roof Rating Council 
•  Home Ventilating Institute 
• 
•  National Fenestration Rating Council 
•  Underwriters Laboratory 
•  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Appliance Certification Database 
•  U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) ENERGY STAR Product Directory 
•  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense Product Directory 
•  SoCal Water Smart Program 
•  Solar Rating and Certification Corporation 
 
Product Catalogue  
The HERO program uses a custom database (product catalogue) that aggregates product records and associated 
details (i.e. manufacturer, brand, model, performance specifications, etc.) from the third-party reference sources 
listed  above.  Aggregated  product  records  are  then  filtered  on  the  defined  eligibility  specifications  for  each 
product type and flagged as being eligible or not eligible for HERO financing. The product catalogue includes over 
1 million eligible product records that are available to contractors and property owners for their projects and is 
updated on a daily basis to ensure that records are consistent with the third-party product directories. 
 
In addition to the HERO Product Eligibility Specifications, all product specifications and installation quality must 
meet or exceed applicable local, state, and/or federal permitting, codes, and standards.  
 

3.1.2 Eligible Projects 
Any project that meets the eligibility criteria, including the new and ongoing developments of such projects, are 
eligible to be funded with the proceeds.

3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
In order to use the proceeds of the issuance, the home improvement project must meet the following eligibility 
criteria: 
 

1.  The project must fall under one or more of the three categories specified above in section 3.1.1.  
2.  The project must meet certain product specific eligibility criteria, as outlined in Appendix 1. The 

products that are used for the project must meet the product-specific eligibility criteria detail the 
minimum product performance, installation values, and/or qualification requirements for each product 
type. 

3.  The  used  product’s  energy/water  efficiency  or  renewable  energy  generation  performance  must  be 
measurable  and  verifiable  for  its  installed  application  in  a  broad  variety  of  single-family  residential 
property settings. 

4.  The  used  product’s  energy  efficiency/water  efficiency/energy  generation  must  be  achieved  through 

5. 

broadly available, non-proprietary technology that is offered by more than one manufacturer. 
If the cost of a qualified product for a project is significantly greater than their conventional/standard 
efficiency  counterpart,  the  incremental  cost  incurred  will  be  offset  by  direct  savings  (i.e.  utility  bill 
reduction)  or  indirect  savings  (i.e.  property  value  increase,  induced  economic  impact,  etc.)  within  a 
reasonable period of time. 

6.  The projects must be funded within the 24 months prior to the issuance of the bond. 

 
As  the  program  administrator  of  the  HERO  Program,  Renovate  America  receives  applications  for  potential 
projects through contractor referrals. Each contractor must be licensed and bonded by the California Contractors 
State License Board and must be registered with Renovate America to participate in the HERO program. In this 
process, Renovate America ensures that the projects meet the program criteria and product specific eligibility 
criteria.   
 
 

3.3        Management of Proceeds  
The Notes are secured by all PACE assessments in the pool, an amount equal to or greater than the amount of 
the bond issuance. The Issuer is the buyer of PACE bonds issued by the partnering municipalities in the HERO 
Program. 256,198,000.00 USD of the net proceeds arising from the issuance of the Notes shall be used to repay 
the  initial  PACE  bonds  funding  eligible  products.  The  remaining  64,045,000.00  USD  of  the  proceeds  will  be 
deposited in a pre-funding account as described below. The initial and subsequent PACE Bonds will be acquired 
by the Issuer from HERO Funding, LLC (the “Transferor”). The Issuer is an exempted company incorporated with 
limited liability. 
 
On or before the Closing Date, the Issuer’s ABS Note Trustee will establish and maintain in the name of the Issuer, 
in the trust for the benefit of the noteholders, an account (the “Prefunding Account”). On the Closing Date, upon 
receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes and the sale of the Residual Certificate, the Issuer will deposit 
in the Prefunding Account an amount equal to approximately 64,045,000.00 USD, which may be used to acquire 
up  to  66,025,000.00  USD  in  subsequent  PACE  Bonds  that  meet  the  same  PACE  Bonds  eligibility  criteria.  The 
purchase  of the PACE  bonds  is  done  by  using  the  proceeds  from the  Notes,  resulting  in  full  allocation  of  the 
proceeds to the PACE bonds that are backed by the assessment pool for the Notes.

3.4 
   Reporting  
Allocation Reporting 
As  all  of  the  initial  proceeds  will  be  allocated  immediately,  verification  on  allocation  of  the  proceeds  will  be 
disclosed all at once at issuance of the Notes in the offering memorandum and any subsequent purchases will 
consist solely of PACE Bonds that meet the PACE Bonds eligibility criteria.   
 
Impact Reporting 
Renovate America utilizes a proprietary calculation model to estimate the environmental impacts of the projects 
related to PACE Bonds. Renovate America reports on estimated impact in the following areas: 

•  Water savings,  
•  Energy savings,  
•  Renewable energy generation, and  
•  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions.  

 
Renovate America calculates the estimated impact in each of these areas using proprietary forecasting models 
that are largely derived from relevant third-party sources. Each model is customized for inputs that are specific 
to  the  property  being  assessed,  taking  into  account  the  location  of  house,  the  year  built,  the  number  of 
occupants, climate zone, etc. Where applicable, Renovate America reports on both annual and life-time metrics 
of  the  installed  improvements.  The  impact  reporting  methodology,  its  original  third-party  source,  and  the 
associated metrics are listed below, disaggregated by different variables.   
 
Water Savings 

1.  Methodology 

Water savings estimates are reported for both indoor and outdoor water efficiency projects. This impact 
model derives primarily from methodologies used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
WaterSense  Program,  the  California  Department  of  Water  Resources,  and  the  California  Institute  for 
Public Policy. 

2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

a.  Annual Water savings (gallons & bill savings) 
b.  Lifetime Water savings (gallons & bill savings) 

 
Energy Savings  

1.  Methodology 

Energy savings estimates are reported for each energy efficiency home improvement project. The impact 
model used to calculate home energy savings derives from calculation methodologies used by the U.S. 
Department of Energy (DOE).  

2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

a.  Annual kWh Savings 
b.  Annual Therm Savings 
c.  Annual Energy Savings (kWh-e & bill savings) 
d.  Lifetime Energy Savings (kWh-e & bill savings)

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction  

1.  Methodology 

GHG  emission  reductions are  reported  for  both  energy  efficiency  projects  and  projects that  generate 
renewable  energy.  The  impact  model  used  to  calculate  GHG  emission  reduction  derives  from 
methodologies used by the U.S. EPA eGRID Power Profiler, and the GHG Equivalency Calculator. 

2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

a.  Annual Emission Reduction (Tons GHG) 
b.  Lifetime Emission Reduction (Tons GHG) 

 

Renewable Energy Generation  

1.  Methodology 

Renewable  energy  generation  estimates  are  reported  for  solar  photovoltaic  installation  projects.  The 
impact  model  used  to  calculate  renewable  energy  generation  estimates  derives  from  methodologies 
used by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's PV Watts Calculator. 

2.  Specific Impact Metrics 

a.  Sum of Solar System Size (W) 
b.  Annual Energy Savings (kWh & bill savings) 
c.  Lifetime Energy Savings (kWh & bill savings)

4. SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
Renovate America’s issuance supports investments in residential renewable energy, energy efficiency and water 
efficiency  by  providing  financing  to  eligible  home  improvement  projects.  Renovate  America  allocates  the 
proceeds from the Notes to the purchase of PACE bonds, which are backed by the projects and products managed 
through the HERO program.   
 
The HERO program is an effective way to promote the uptake of energy and water efficiency products as well as 
renewable energy-generating products in the U.S. PACE incentivizes home owners to install green products by 
financing their installation through increased home property taxes, payable over an extended time frame. Hence, 
homeowners do not have to pay for these energy efficiency renovations upfront, and associated costs are often 
offset by energy savings. Renovate America, as a PACE program administrator, offers homeowners financing for 
the green investments which are paid back through an increase in property taxes. In addition, the HERO program 
simplifies installation of these green improvements by offering homeowners an innovative technology platform 
where the homeowners can select green improvements products offered at fair market value, select contractors 
(usually local), and take advantage of strong consumer protection mechanisms. By leveraging the PACE program, 
Renovate America, with its HERO program, is promoting and helping home owners install green projects and 
improve home energy efficiency. 
 
HERO  bases  products’  eligibility  on  two  sets  of  criteria—HERO  program-specific  criteria,  and  product-specific 
criteria.  The  product-specific  criteria  are  based  on  third-party  efficiency  standards  and  certified  product 
directories. Furthermore, the HERO program ensures compliance to the eligibility criteria through an internal 
review process for product selection. Renovate America’s rigorous approach to quantifying and reporting impact 
estimations  provides  transparency  to  investors  regarding  the  impact  of  projects  funded  by  the  Notes.  The 
issuance supports investments in projects with positive environmental impacts, including residential renewable 
energy, energy efficiency and water efficiency by providing financing to eligible home improvement projects in 
California.  
 
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2016: Sustainalytics has determined that the issuance aligns with the four 
pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2016. For detailed information please refer to the Green Bond/Green Bond 
Programme External Review Form. 
 
Conclusion 
By  the  issuance  of  the  Notes,  Renovate  America  supports  residential  home  improvements  in  the  areas  of 
renewable energy, energy efficiency and water efficiency by providing financing to eligible home improvement 
projects. Sustainalytics is of the opinion that the issuance with current market standards and norms, including 
the  four  pillars  of  the  Green  Bond  Principles  2016.  The  use  of  proceeds,  project  selection,  management  of 
proceeds, and reporting are robust and credible. The criteria that are used for the Notes are comprehensive and 
the selection processes are diligent.
