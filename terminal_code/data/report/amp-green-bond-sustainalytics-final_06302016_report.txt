1. PREFACE 
 
American Municipal Power, Inc. (“AMP”), a non-profit wholesale power supplier and services provider, 
has  engaged  Sustainalytics  to  review  its  planned  Meldahl  Hydroelectric  Project  Revenue  Bond,  Series 
2016A Green Bond (“Green Bond”) and provide an opinion. As part of this engagement, Sustainalytics 
held  conversations  with  AMP’s  treasury  and  sustainability  teams  to  understand  the  use  of  proceeds, 
management of proceeds and reporting aspects of its Green Bond as well as sustainability strategy of 
AMP. Sustainalytics also reviewed relevant public and internal documents and provided its opinion on the 
Green Bond. This document contains two sections:  Framework Overview – a summary of AMP’s Green 
Bond framework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework.   
 
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
AMP was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The company purchases, generates, 
manages,  and  sells  electric  capacity  and  energy  to  municipal  communities  in  Ohio,  Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Maryland, and Delaware.  
 
AMP will use the proceeds from the approximately 100 million USD Green Bond to complete the financing 
of  the  Meldahl  Hydroelectric  Project.  The  Meldahl  Project  is  a  105  MW  run-of-river  hydroelectric 
generating  facility  which  went  into  commercial  operation  on  April  12,  2016  at  the  Captain  Anthony 
Meldahl Dam on the Ohio River. The Meldahl Project diverts water from the existing U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers’ Meldahl Locks and Dam through bulb turbines to generate an average gross annual output of 
approximately 555.562 million kWh. The site includes an intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete 
powerhouse, and a tailrace channel. The powerhouse houses three horizontal 35-MW bulb-type turbine 
and generating units with an FERC Licensed rated capacity of 105 MW at a gross head of 30 feet.1 
  
3. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
For this green bond issued by AMP a framework has been created that follows the four key pillars of the 
Green Bond Principles (“GBP”): 

  Use of Proceeds 
  Selection Process 
  Management of Proceeds 
  Reporting 

 
3.1   Use of Proceeds 
The proceeds of the Green Bond will be allocated towards financing a run-of-river hydroelectric project.  
 
The context: Reducing the company’s overall emissions profile is among AMP’s Sustainability Principles. 
AMP recognizes that reductions of airborne emissions can be achieved through investing in zero-emission

generation technologies such as hydroelectric and other renewables. AMP states that it is mindful that 
greenhouse gas emissions will be limited at some point in the future, and therefore the company aims to 
prudently  invest  in  projects  to  offset  carbon  dioxide  and  other  GHG  emissions  from  its  fossil  fuel 
generation resources.2  
 
Use of Proceeds: The proceeds of the Green Bond will be used to finance additional construction costs, 
repay draws on a line of credit and fund a deposit to the parity common reserve account of the Meldahl 
Project (“Meldahl Project”), a three-unit run-of-river hydroelectric generating facility constructed on the 
Captain Anthony Meldahl Locks and Dam, an existing dam on the Ohio River. The project produces GHG-
emission-free renewable energy that will reduce the company’s participating member’s overall emissions 
profile.  
 
3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
AMP’s  management  sets  guidelines  and  priorities  for  all  projects,  including  renewable  energy 
projects.  The selection of projects is based on the following considerations: 
 

  The time period in which the expenditures are to be made; 
  Expenditures that are eligible for reimbursement. These expenditures include design, engineering 

and surveying that occur before the commencement of a project; 

  Expenditures that have not been allocated to grants or other bond issues. 

 
 

3.3      Management of Proceeds  
The proceeds from the AMP Green Bonds will be held in a trust account and used to i) repay AMP’s line 
of credit for the costs of construction allocable to the completion of the Meldahl Project, ii) fund a reserve 
fund securing bonds issued for the Project, and iii) pay the costs of issuance for the bonds. Therefore, all 
the funds will be allocated immediately. Under the Master Trust Indenture securing the bond issued for 
the  Project,  including  the  Green  Bonds,  AMP  must  comply  with  various  requirements  in  order  for 
expenses  related  to  the  Meldahl  Project  to  be  paid,  including  those  pertaining  to  the  verification  of 
expenses, appropriate AMP signatories and the transfer of funds to a Depository, as well as to the Bond 
Trustee.  Furthermore,  accounts  are  reconciled on  a monthly  basis  to  the  activity  that  occurred  in  the 
account.   
 
3.4    Reporting  
AMP commits to provide reporting on the following KPIs for the Meldahl Project within the company’s 
annual sustainability report and through quarterly update reports, both published on the company’s 
website.   
 

  Net renewable capacity (MW) 
  Net annual renewable generation (MWh) 
  Capacity factor (%)

4  SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
 
Commitment  to  renewable  energy  development:  In  2005,  AMP’s  Board  of  Trustees  adopted  the 
company’s  Environmental  Stewardship  Principles.  The  principles  were  renamed  the  Sustainability 
Principles in 2011, and continue to be revised to maintain their relevance, with the last revision by the 
company’s Board of Trustees taking place in 2013. There are currently seven Sustainability Principles that 
AMP uses to guide its approach to sustainability. These principles include a commitment to both providing 
a balanced and sustainable power supply portfolio and reducing the company’s overall emissions profile. 
To adhere to these commitments, AMP describes a number of investments in renewable energy, including 
run-of-river hydroelectric, wind, solar, and landfill gas. In addition, AMP commits to publically reporting 
GHG emissions avoidance data on an annually basis, demonstrating a commitment to transparency.  
 
Large-scale run-of-river hydro with overall positive impact: Sustainalytics recognizes that the Meldahl 
Project, which will result in electricity generation for AMP of 105 MW, does not fall within the generally 
accepted  limit  for  small-scale  run-of-river  hydro  of  15  MW.  However,  because  the  Meldahl  Project  is 
located at the existing Captain Anthony Meldahl Dam on the Ohio River, it will not result in the negative 
environmental impacts, such as loss of wildlife habitat and aquatic biodiversity, that are often associated 
with large-scale hydro development, which typically involves the construction of a new dam and reservoir. 
Sustainalytics is therefore of the opinion that the Meldahl Project offers clear environmental benefits and 
net positive impact. This view is in line with generally accepted standards.3 
 
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2016: Sustainalytics has determined that AMP’s Green Bond 
aligns to the four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2016. For detailed information please refer to 
Appendix B: Green Bond Principles Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning electricity 
generating units amounts to roughly 31 percent of the United States’ overall CO2 emissions, the largest 
single source of CO2 emissions for the country.4 By focusing on an area of such high environmental impact, 
AMP is targeting carbon reduction efforts in an industry that would benefit significantly from mitigating 
further negative environmental impacts. 
 
AMP’s Green Bond will finance the completion of the Meldahl Project which provides GHG-emission-free 
renewable energy to the municipalities that it serves. Although the Meldahl Project is considered large-
scale  hydro,  the  construction  has  occurred  on  an  existing  dam,  and  has  therefore  avoided  any  of  the 
negative  impacts  that  are  often  associated  with  large-scale  hydroelectric  development  projects. 
Furthermore, the Meldahl Project has received the required environmental permitting under the Clean 

 
3 For example, in the Climate Bond Standards large-scale hydroelectric projects greater than 20 MW are acceptable for green bonds if the 
construction involves modifying existing large-scale hydro in temperate zones or involves the re-powering of existing large-scale hydro.

Water Act and the Navigable Rivers and Harbors Act. Hence, investing in this Green Bond can be seen as 
investing in renewable energy generation that results in a positive environmental impact. 
 
AMP’s Green Bond follows the guidance provided by the Green Bond Principles 2016 and are in alignment 
with its four components: the use of proceeds, process of project evaluation and selection, management 
of proceeds and reporting. 
 
The  above  two  points  should  provide  confidence  to  investors  that  AMP’s  Green  Bond  is  robust  and 
credible.
