1. PREFACE 
 
American Municipal Power, Inc. (“AMP”), a non-profit wholesale power supplier and services provider, 
has engaged Sustainalytics to review its planned Combined Hydroelectric Projects Revenue Bonds, Series 
2016A  (Green  Bonds)  (the  “Bonds”)  and  provide  an  opinion  as  to  the  environmental  benefits  of  the 
projects  to be  financed and the  adherence  of the  bonds to the Green Bond Principles.  As part of this 
engagement,  Sustainalytics  held  conversations  with  AMP’s  treasury  and  sustainability  teams  to 
understand the use and management of proceeds of the Bonds as well as sustainability strategy of AMP. 
Sustainalytics  also  reviewed  relevant  public  and  internal  documents  and  provided  its  opinion  on  the 
Bonds. This document contains two sections:  Framework Overview – a summary of AMP’s Green Bond 
framework; and Sustainalytics’ Opinion – an opinion on the framework.   
 
2. INTRODUCTION 
 
AMP was founded in 1971 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. The company purchases, generates, 
manages,  and  sells  electric  capacity  and  energy  to  municipal  communities  in  Ohio,  Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, Virginia, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Maryland, and Delaware.  
 
AMP will use the proceeds of the Bonds to finance, retire interim financing, fund a deposit to the Parity 
Common  Reserve  account,  pay  the  costs  of  issuance,  and/or  refund  a  portion  of  its  bonds  previously 
issued  to  provide  financing  for  three  run-of-river  hydroelectric  projects  (the  “Projects”).  The  Projects 
consist of the Cannelton Project, an 88 MW project located on the Kentucky shore of the Cannelton Locks 
and Dam on the Ohio River; the Smithland Project, a 76 MW project located on the Kentucky shore of the 
Smithland Lock and Dam on the Ohio River; and the Willow Island Project, a 44 MW project located on 
the West Virginia shore of the Willow Island Locks and Dam on the Ohio River. The Willow Island and 
Cannelton Projects are currently in commercial operation, with the Smithland Project projected to be in 
commercial operation by February 2017.  
  
3. FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW 
For this Bond issue a framework has been created by AMP that follows the four key pillars of the Green 
Bond Principles (“GBP”): 
  Use of Proceeds 
  Selection Process 
  Management of Proceeds 
  Reporting 

 
3.1   Use of Proceeds 
 
Use of Proceeds: The proceeds of the Bonds will be used to finance the Projects additional construction 
costs, repay draws on a line of credit, refund a portion of AMP’s Combined Hydroelectric Projects Revenue 
Bonds,  Series  2009C  (Tax-Exempt)  (the  “2009C  Bonds”)  previously  issued  to  finance  a  portion  of  the

construction costs of the Projects, fund a deposit to the parity common reserve account, and pay the costs 
of issuance of the Bonds. Please see project descriptions below for additional details. 
 
The context: Reducing the company’s overall emissions profile is among AMP’s Sustainability Principles. 
AMP recognizes that reductions of airborne emissions can be achieved through investing in zero-emission 
generation technologies, such as hydroelectric and other renewable energy sources. AMP believes that 
greenhouse gas emissions will be limited at some point in the future, and therefore the company aims to 
prudently  invest  in  projects  to  offset  carbon  dioxide  and  other  GHG  emissions  from  its  fossil  fuel 
generation resources.1  
 
Cannelton: The Cannelton Project is located on the Kentucky shore of the Cannelton Locks and Dam on 
the Ohio River. It is three miles upstream from Cannelton, Indiana.  The Cannelton Project diverts water 
from the existing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Army Corps”) Cannelton Locks and Dam through 
three 29.3 MW bulb turbines and has an estimated total rated capacity of 88 MW. The site includes an 
intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse and a tailrace channel. The first unit of the 
Cannelton Project entered commercial operation in January 2016, the second unit entered commercial 
operation in March 2016 and the third and final unit entered commercial operation in June 2016. 
 
Willow Island: The Willow Island Project is located on the West Virginia shore of the Willow Island Locks 
and Dam on the Ohio River, approximately 3.4 miles upstream from Waverly, West Virginia.  The Willow 
Island Project diverts water from the existing Army Corps Willow Island Locks and Dam through two 22 
MW bulb turbines and will have an estimated total rated capacity of 44 MW. The site includes an intake 
approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse and a tailrace channel. The first unit at Willow Island 
entered commercial operation in January 2016 and the second and final unit at Willow Island entered 
commercial operation in February 2016. 
 
Smithland: The Smithland Project is located on the Kentucky shore of the Smithland Lock and Dam on the 
Ohio River, approximately 62.5 miles upstream of the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.  The 
Smithland Project will divert water from the existing Army Corps Smithland Locks and Dam through three 
25.3 MW bulb turbines and will have an estimated total rated capacity of 76 MW. The site will include an 
intake approach channel, a reinforced concrete powerhouse and a tailrace channel. AMP anticipates that 
the Smithland units  will enter commercial operation as follows: the first  unit in January  2017 and the 
second and third units in February 2017. 
 
3.2  Project Evaluation and Selection Process 
AMP’s  management  sets  guidelines  and  priorities  for  all  projects,  including  renewable  energy 
projects.  The selection of projects is based on the following considerations: 
 

  The time period in which the expenditures are to be made; 
  Expenditures that are eligible for reimbursement. These expenditures include design, engineering 

and surveying that occur before the commencement of a project; 

  Expenditures that have not been previously financed through other bond issues.

3.3      Management of Proceeds  
The  proceeds  from  the  Bonds  will  be  held  in  a  trust  account  and  used  (i)  make  a  deposit  to  the 
Construction Account under the Indenture to finance capital expenditures, costs and expenses associated 
with the Projects; (ii) repay draws on a line of credit made to finance certain expenditures the proceeds 
of  which  were  used  to  provide  interim  financing  for  certain  capital  expenditures,  costs  and  expenses 
relating  to  the  Projects;  (iii)  fund  a  deposit  to  the  Parity  Common  Reserve  Account;  and  (iv)  refund  a 
portion of the 2009C Bonds;  and (v) pay the costs of issuance of the Bonds.  
 
Under the Indenture securing the Bonds issued for the Projects, including the Bonds, AMP must comply 
with  various  requirements  in  order  for  expenses  related  to  the  Projects  to  be  paid,  including  those 
pertaining to the verification of expenses, appropriate AMP signatories and the  transfer of funds to a 
Depository, as well as to the Bond Trustee. Furthermore, accounts are reconciled on a monthly basis to 
the activity that occurred in the account.   
 
3.4    Reporting  
AMP hereby will provide reporting on the following Key Performance Indicators for the Projects within 
the company’s annual sustainability report and through quarterly update reports, both published on the 
company’s website.   
 

  Net renewable capacity (MW) 
  Net annual renewable generation (MWh) 
  Capacity factor (%) 
  GHG emissions avoided (Tons) (quarterly and annually)

4  SUSTAINALYTICS’ OPINION 
 
Commitment  to  renewable  energy  development:  In  2005,  AMP’s  Board  of  Trustees,  (the  “Board”) 
adopted  the  company’s  Environmental  Stewardship  Principles.  The  principles  were  renamed  the 
Sustainability Principles in 2011, and are periodically revised, with the last revision by the Board taking 
place in 2013. There are currently seven Sustainability Principles that AMP uses to guide its approach to 
sustainability.  These  principles  include  a  commitment  to  providing  a  balanced  and  sustainable  power 
supply portfolio and reducing the company’s overall emissions profile. To adhere to these commitments, 
AMP has made significant investments in renewable energy, including run-of-river hydroelectric, wind, 
solar, and landfill gas. In addition, the company plans to publicly report GHG emissions avoidance data on 
an annual basis, demonstrating a commitment to transparency.  
 
Large-scale run-of-river hydro with overall positive impact: Sustainalytics recognizes that the Projects do 
not fall within the generally accepted limit for small-scale run-of-river hydro of 15 MW. However, because 
the  Projects  are  located  at  existing  dams  on  the  Ohio  River,  they  will  not  result  in  the  negative 
environmental impacts, such as loss of wildlife habitat and aquatic biodiversity, that are often associated 
with large-scale hydro development, which typically involves the construction of a new dam and reservoir. 
Sustainalytics  is  therefore  of  the  opinion  that  the  Projects  offer  clear  environmental  benefits  and  net 
positive impact. This view is in line with generally accepted standards.2 
 
Alignment with Green Bond Principles 2016: Sustainalytics has determined that the Bonds align with the 
four pillars of the Green Bond Principles 2016. For detailed information, please refer to Appendix B: Green 
Bond Principles Green Bond/Green Bond Programme External Review Form. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning electricity 
generating units amounts to roughly 31 percent of the United States’ overall CO2 emissions, the largest 
single source of CO2 emissions for the country.3 By focusing on an area of such high environmental impact, 
AMP is targeting carbon reduction efforts in an industry that would benefit significantly from mitigating 
further negative environmental impacts. 
 
The Projects financed with the proceeds of the Bonds provide GHG-emission-free renewable energy to 
the  municipalities  that  AMP  serves.  Although  the  Projects  are  considered  large-scale  hydro,  the 
construction  has  occurred  on  existing  dams  on  the  Ohio  River,  and  has  therefore  avoided  any  of  the 
negative  impacts  that  are  often  associated  with  large-scale  hydroelectric  development  projects. 
Furthermore, the Projects have received the required environmental permits under the Clean Water Act 
and  the  Navigable  Rivers  and  Harbors  Act.  Hence,  investing  in  the  Bonds  can  be  seen  as  investing  in 
renewable energy generation that results in a positive environmental impact. 
 
 
2 For example, in the Climate Bond Standards large-scale hydroelectric projects greater than 20 MW are acceptable for green bonds if the 
construction involves modifying existing large-scale hydro in temperate zones or involves the re-powering of existing large-scale hydro.
